title: "Virtualisation"
---

Virtualisation (as the name implies) is the process of creating a virtual representation of a physical 'thing'. Generally, it refers to an abstraction layer on top of a hardware system, which allows efficient utilisation of physical resources, by separating it into smaller, more flexible, often software-managed divisions.

The concept of virtualisation is wider and more generalised than just Virtual Machines (VMs) or Containers, and [dates back to the early days of computing](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26996_01/E18549/html/VMUSG1010.html). Whenever a physical device (or part of one) is emulated in a software representation in a way that another system can interact with it **as though it were a phsyical device**, that is virtualisation. Watch the 5min intro below.

For the rest of this material we focus on the virtualisation in terms of Virtual Machines and Containers, but it's worth noting that when people talk about storage, compute & networking cloud services these are all 'virtualised'.
