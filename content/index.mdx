This site contains guided learning material related to virtualisation and containers, and how to get comfortable working with docker specifically. The content is aimed primarily at developers so the focus is on:

- Understanding the value offered by different virtualisation technologies
- Understanding how they fit into the development workflow (for local development and automated deployment CI/CD processes)
- Getting comfortable working with continaerised applications (in docker)

# Structure

The content follows this structure:

#### Fundamentals

- Virtualisation
- Virtualisation Technologies
- VMs vs. Containers
- Use cases

#### Docker
- Dockerfiles and Images
- Containers
- Storage (volumes / bind mounts)
- Networks
- docker-compose
- CLI Cheatsheet

# Goals

The goal is to get you feeling confident enough with the tech that you feel comfortable incorporating it into your day-to-day developer workflow.

# How to use this content

One page at a time, simples! Seriously though, it's written with the intent of starting at the beginning and building on that. You can jump in at the docker stuff if you don't care about the fundamentals but you'll be missing out.

There is text content interspersed with videos, snippets of terminal commands and exercises to consolidate what you've learned.
